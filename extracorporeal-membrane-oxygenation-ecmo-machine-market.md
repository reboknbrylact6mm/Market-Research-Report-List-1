<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Venoarterial (VA)</li><li>Venovenous (VV)</li><li>Arteriovenous (AV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ECMO machine market comprises three primary types: Venoarterial (VA), Venovenous (VV), and Arteriovenous (AV). VA ECMO provides both cardiac and respiratory support by drawing blood from a vein and returning it to an artery, making it suitable for patients with both cardiac failure and severe respiratory distress. VV ECMO offers respiratory support only, facilitating oxygenation by circulating blood between two veins. AV ECMO is primarily used in organ transplant procedures and similar applications, providing specialized support for both oxygenation and perfusion.</p></p>
